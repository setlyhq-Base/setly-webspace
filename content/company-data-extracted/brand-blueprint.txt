SETLY — Brand Blueprint & Vision
 Document
Founder’s Journey
In January 2017, when Kiran Revally first arrived in the United States for his
Master’s, he experienced first-hand the challenges that many international
students face — finding accommodation, connecting with the right people,
arranging transportation from JFK to New Haven, and even locating groceries and
basic essentials. These early struggles planted the seed for what would later
evolve into SETLY — a platform built to make settling into a new place seamless,
supportive, and smarter.
Vision
SETLY envisions a world where humans and technology evolve together — where
intelligent systems understand human needs and simplify transitions in life. The
goal is to create a connected ecosystem that acts as a “Personal Advisory &
Lifestyle System” — from moving to a new country, finding a home, building a
community, and accessing essential services, to designing smarter daily
experiences.
Mission
SETLY’s mission is to empower individuals through human-enhanced technology.
We aim to redefine the experience of resettling and adapting, making every
transition — geographical or emotional — effortless, efficient, and enriching.
Brand Essence
SETLY derives from the idea of “settling” — but with intention and intelligence. It
reflects the act of finding balance, establishing roots, and evolving in new
environments with the help of technology that feels human. The brand embodies
calm, clarity, and confidence for people navigating change.
Domains and Expansion
Currently, SETLY operates under setly.net and setly.in, catering to both global
and Indian audiences. While setly.net focuses on international expansion and

professional communities, setly.in will serve as a bridge for Indian students,
travelers, and professionals relocating abroad. The long-term plan includes
acquiring setly.com as the flagship domain.
Future Roadmap
1. Launch SETLY 1.0 web platform for global users.
2. Introduce SETLY mobile app with smart advisory and location-based
recommendations.
3. Build partnerships with universities, housing networks, and relocation agencies.
4. Integrate AI-driven personalization through SETLY’s Human-Enhanced Advisor.
5. Expand into lifestyle, finance, and emotional wellness ecosystems by 2027.
6. Develop SETLY Smart Devices — a futuristic line of connected lifestyle
products.
Tagline
“Human Enhanced.” — A reminder that technology should amplify human
potential, not replace it.
