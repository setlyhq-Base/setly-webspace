■ Founding Vision
“To become the North Star for anyone moving to a new place — guiding them from
landing to belonging.”
Setly was born from a deeply personal experience — a journey of transition, challenge, and
adaptation. When international students and professionals move abroad, they face a maze of
uncertainty: finding housing, reliable contacts, daily essentials, local rules, and belonging.
Setly exists to make that experience human, guided, and effortless — through AI, verified
communities, and partnerships.

■ Our Core Philosophy
 Technology should amplify comfort and trust.
 Moving is not just about relocation — it’s about redefining identity.
 Every move is emotional, not just logistical — Setly bridges emotion with innovation.

■ Founder’s Message
“We don’t just move people. We move dreams, ambitions, and emotions — one
Setly journey at a time.”
Setly is not just a relocation tool. It’s a life companion — one that learns, guides, and grows
with every mover. We exist to ensure that no one ever feels lost when starting over.
