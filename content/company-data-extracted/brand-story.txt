■ SETLY
Find Your Flow, Anywhere.
Because settling isn’t about stopping — it’s about starting again.
■ The Origin Story
Setly began with one traveler, a backpack, and a dream — to build a life halfway across the
world and make it feel like home. When Kiran Revally moved from Hyderabad to the U.S., he
realized the hardest part of relocating wasn’t the visa or the work — it was belonging. Finding
a home, friends, rhythm, identity. That search became the spark behind Setly.
■ What Setly Stands For
S – Start | E – Evolve | T – Thrive | L – Live | Y – Your way. Setly isn’t about ‘settling down.’
It’s about helping people find stability without losing momentum. Whether it’s moving cities,
countries, or careers — Setly helps you connect, adapt, and rise — your way.
■ The Vision
To make relocation and reinvention beautifully simple. A space where anyone — student,
creator, or professional — can find trusted housing, access community resources, connect
with local mentors, and build a life that feels like them.
■ The Philosophy
The world doesn’t need more settlers. It needs more people who Setly — gracefully,
purposefully, confidently. Setly is for the modern mover, the digital nomad, the immigrant
dreamer, the one who’s always becoming — never just arriving.
■■■ Founder’s Note
When I moved from Hyderabad to the U.S., I realized the toughest part wasn’t work — it was
everything outside of it. Finding the right apartment, friends, vibe, even the right grocery store
— it all took time, energy, and hundreds of tabs. So I built Setly — a smarter way to move and
belong. Setly is for every dreamer who wants to start fresh without feeling lost.
