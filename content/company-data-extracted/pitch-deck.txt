Vision: Empowering every mover — students, professionals, and explorers — to
feel at home anywhere.
The Problem
Moving to a new country or city is stressful. Finding accommodation,
transportation, groceries, and social support can take weeks — sometimes
months. This challenge is amplified for international students and professionals
who lack a trusted network.
The Opportunity
Global migration is at an all-time high, with millions relocating for education and
work every year. Yet, 70% face serious adaptation challenges. Setly aims to fill this
gap with a single ecosystem for relocation, connection, and everyday assistance.
The Solution
Setly is an AI-driven relocation assistant and community platform. It connects
users with housing, transport, essentials, and verified local connections — all
personalized through intelligent automation.

Pilot Strategy
Starting with international students in the U.S., Setly’s MVP connects verified
housing, roommates, and essential local services. Once validated, expansion will
include working professionals, digital nomads, and families relocating abroad.
Why Now
AI technology is advancing rapidly, enabling personal assistants to predict and
automate human needs. With increasing migration and digital integration, Setly is
positioned perfectly to become the next-generation relocation companion.
Business Model
Setly generates revenue via subscription plans, partner commissions, and
premium concierge services. Future monetization includes relocation insurance,
verified community marketplaces, and B2B relocation partnerships.
Market Landscape & Competitive Advantage
Unlike fragmented relocation services, Setly provides a full-stack ecosystem —
blending AI-powered assistance with community-driven reliability. The brand’s
authenticity, cultural trust, and scalable tech foundation make it unique.
Go-To-Market Strategy
Setly will launch targeted campaigns in student communities, Indian diaspora
groups, and LinkedIn relocation networks. University ambassadors and
micro-influencer partnerships will drive early adoption.
Financial Ask & Use of Funds
We seek an initial seed round of $250,000 to build MVP1, establish brand
presence, and expand user testing. Funds will cover AI infrastructure, marketing,
and university partnerships.
Future Vision
By 2027, Setly envisions becoming the global platform for relocation and lifestyle
transition — powered by ethical AI and human empathy.
